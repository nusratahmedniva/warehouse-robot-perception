# Avatar-Mediated Human-Robot Interaction in Virtual Worlds

A wheeled warehouse robot in a Unity simulation is guided to an unknown
goal by human avatars: at each junction it finds the nearest worker, asks
for a direction, reads a pointing gesture and takes the indicated way.
Python handles perception and decisions; Unity runs the simulation.

## Repository layout

- `robot_vision/`: Python perception, decision rules, Unity bridge, evaluation
- `unity/Robotics-Warehouse/WarehouseProjectURP/`: Unity project (2022.3.62f3, URP)
- `external/media_pipe_gesture/`: gesture module by Anisha (git submodule)

## Getting started

1. `git clone --recurse-submodules <this repository's URL>`
2. Python 3.12: create a virtual environment in `robot_vision/`, then
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Unity Hub: install Unity 2022.3.62f3, then add the project folder above
4. Mixamo character files are not included (licence terms). Obtain them
   separately and place them in `Assets/WarehouseRobot/Characters/` as
   `worker.fbx`, `walking.fbx` and `idle.fbx`.

## Status

Work in progress; final version due 22 October 2026.
